## How to use these spreadsheets
This is how I use them: I copy the file and paste into a notepad, save the notepad as a .fods file and then open that file with libreoffice calc.
(that's how I do it, if there is a better way let me know) :)
## .fods spreadsheets
+ [overlay with 2 inputs](2_inputoverlay.fods) if you download this spreadsheet you can put the name of you base video and overlay video or image and you can add some variables such as scale, delay time, start time, end time and x, y position. Then you can copy the text in red to the terminal and run. 
+ [25 different overlay instructions in one ffmpeg command](move_overlay_25_times.fods) if you want a overlay that moves around in a linear direction you can use this to make a single ffmpeg command with 25 different moves. One tab uses 2 inputs and another tab uses 25 input videos.
